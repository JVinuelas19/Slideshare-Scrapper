# Slideshare-Scrapper v1.0
Script that scrapes any book/presentation from slideshare.net through its URL and provides a PDF file with the book.
It features some basic actions to avoid straight bans from websites employing a random timer between requests and also different headers for each request. For the basic use that is desired to (just personal use) it is more than enough.
Use it with your own discretion and please don't profit with it!

# Update v1.1:
Now the script has more features: 
- Timers
- Detailed information about book paths
- Books are now saved with their original title instead of 'Book'
- Commented code
- Bug fixes (headers had errors that lead to execution errors)

# Update v1.2:
New options added:
- You can choose between downloading a book/slides directly from a URL or from a txt file that contains URLs (one URL per line with no extra chars)
- You can add your own path to store the books. Otherwise the books will be saved in the same location where the code is stored.
- Info about this profile and a donation page has been added to the scrapper when the run is over.
