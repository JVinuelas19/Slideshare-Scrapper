# Version 1.0
Features:
- Scrapes a book/presentation using BeautifulSoup and html concrete tags.
- Random timer between requests
- Random headers from a pool of 3 for each request.

# Update v1.1:
Now the script has more features: 
- Timers
- Detailed information about book paths
- Books are now saved with their original title instead of 'Book'
- Commented code
- Bug fixes (headers had errors that lead to execution errors)

# Update v1.2:
New options added:
- You can choose between downloading a book/slides directly from a URL or from a txt file that contains URLs (one URL per line with no extra chars)
- You can add your own path to store the books. Otherwise the books will be saved in the same location where the code is stored.
- "About me" has been added to the scrapper when the run is over.

For the basic use that is desired to (just personal use) it is more than enough.
Use it with your own discretion and please don't profit with it!
